                    Duracell Inc. is an American manufacturing company owned by Berkshire Hathaway that produces
                    batteries and smart power systems. The company has its origins in the 1920s,
                    <br><br> through the work of Samuel Ruben and Philip Mallory, and the formation of the P.R. Mallory Company.
                    Through a number of corporate mergers and acquisitions,
                    <br> Duracell came to be owned by the consumer products conglomerate Procter & Gamble (P&G). In November 2014,
                    P&G reached an agreement to sell the company to Berkshire Hathaway through a transfer of shares.
                    Under the deal,
                    <br>   Berkshire Hathaway exchanged the shares it held in P&G for ownership of the Duracell business.

                    How To Choose Patio Furniture
                    If your outdoor space is your second family room, make it more welcoming and comfortable with beautiful,
                    durable and functional patio furniture in all styles, sizes, colors and materials. Whatever size your patio,
                    porch, deck or yard, there’s furniture and accessories for your needs.
                    <br><br> If you have a pocket garden, consider fitting in a small bistro set to sit and have coffee with the birds.
                    Do you have a multi-tiered deck? Fill every level with comfortable cushions.
                    A covered porch is ideal for lounging with lemonade.
                    <br>      Whatever your outdoor venue, think about how you want to use the space, whether it’s for a quiet reading zone,
                    cocktail hour or entertainment area. All-weather rugs not only visually softens an outdoor space, it adds comfort,
                    color and it defines the area. When buying outdoor furniture,
                    <br>   remember you need to store it during cooler months to keep it looking its best for years.
                    Extend your outdoor season with great patio furniture for less at Walmart.
